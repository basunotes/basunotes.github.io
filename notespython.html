    <span><b>Notes on Python</b></span>

    <p>
        These notes are mainly for me. They may not be completely accurate, but what's most important to me is gaining a
        functional understanding of Python so I can solve problems with it. I only want to gain a deeper understanding
        insofar as it helps clear confusion and debug errors.
    </p>

    <span id="Variables"><b>Variables</b></span>

    <p>
        A variable in Python is created when you first assign it a value:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 2</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the code above, an object is created to represent the value <code>2</code>.
        A variable <code>x</code> is created if it does not already exist.
        The variable <code>x</code> is then linked to this new object <code>2</code>.
        <br>
        A variable itself never has any <i>type</i>; rather, it refers to a particular
        object at any particular point in time. The object it refers to has a type.
        Despite this very important technical detail, it is not uncommon for people to say that <code>x</code>
        is of type integer, as it refers to an object of type integer.
    </p>

    <p>
        To further emphasize the point that variables have no type, consider the code
        following code:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 2
>>> x = 2.5
>>> x = "A"</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        With each assignment, we have simply made <code>x</code> refer to a different type of object.
        <br>
        What happens to the object it was previously referencing?
        To be imprecise, if the object is no longer in <i>use</i>, then the space it occupied is <i>reclaimed</i>.
        This is known as <i>garbage collection</i> and we might go into detail later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the second line of the following code:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 2
>>> y = x</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the variable <code>x</code> is being used here, it is replaced
        with the object it references, namely <code>2</code>.
        A new variable, <code>y</code>, is created and made to reference the same object.
        Therefore, both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> end up referencing the same object.
        However, there is no <i>link</i> between the two variables.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: smaller;">
        In the following code, the last assignment makes <code>x</code> reference the integer <code>3</code>, but
        it does not change the object <code>y</code> refers to.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 2
>>> y = x
>>> x = x + 1</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        This might be expected behavior for many, but it
        highlights an important fact:
        There is no way to overwrite the value of the object <code>2</code>, as integers are <i>immutable</i> and thus
        can never be changed <i>in place</i>. On the other hand, we have <i>mutable</i> objects, which can be changed in
        place.
        We will discuss them later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python allows us to perform sequence assignments. It pairs the values
        on the right side of the assignment operator with the variables on the
        left side, assigning the values one at a time. The left side of a sequence assignment must be a sequence (such
        as a tuple or list of targets), while the right side can be any iterable object, not just a sequence. Both sides
        must have the same length.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> A, B = 1, 2
>>> A, B
(1, 2)
>>> [A, B] = [3, 4]
>>> A, B
(3, 4)
>>> [a, b, c] = (1, 2, 3) 
>>> a, b, c
(1, 2, 3)
>>> (a, b, c) = 'ABC'
>>> a, c
('A', 'C')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        In Python, slicing allows you to assign values to specific parts of a sequence. For more flexible unpacking, you
        can use a <i>starred target</i> on the left side of an assignment. This lets you match and capture multiple
        elements from an iterable on the right-hand side. This technique is known as sequence unpacking.
        There are some edge cases that need to be considered. I might discuss them later!
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a, *b = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a, b
(1, [2, 3, 4])
>>> *a, b = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a, b
([1, 2, 3], 4)
>>> a, *b, c = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a, b, c
(1, [2, 3], 4)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Python allows for multiple-target and augmented assignments:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = y = z = 1
>>> x, y, z
(1, 1, 1)
>>> x = 'abc'
>>> x += 'd'
>>> x
'abcd'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        It is good practice to give variables descriptive names, unlike in mathematics.
        Moreover, there are certain strict rules that need to be followed; otherwise, you will get a
        syntax error.
    <ul>
        <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
        <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
        <li>A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores</li>
        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive</li>
        <li>A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to give a variable a name with more than one word, there are several naming
        conventions to make it more readable.
        We will use the snake case: <code>word1_word2</code>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Numbers"><b>Numbers</b></span>

    <p>
        Python supports the usual numeric types: integers and floating-point numbers.
        It also provides more advanced numeric programming support, which we will explore later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations. These operators include: Addition
        (<code>+</code>), Subtraction (<code>-</code>), Multiplication (<code>*</code>), Division (<code>/</code>),
        Modulus
        (<code>%</code>), Exponentiation (<code>**</code>), and Floor Division (<code>//</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
        If an expression contains more than one operator, Python uses precedence rules to determine which operation to
        perform first.
        Many of these rules are similar to those in mathematics. For example, multiplication takes precedence over
        addition.
        Expressions within parentheses are evaluated first.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> 2 * 3 + 5
11
>>> 2 * (3 + 5)
16</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If an expression consists of different numeric types, Python converts all the operands up to the type of the
        most complex operand in the expression.
        In the following example, the integer is promoted to a floating-point number.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> 2.5 + 3 
5.5</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        In Python, you can represent numbers not only in decimal (base 10), but also in hexadecimal (base 16), octal
        (base 8), and binary (base 2) using specific prefixes:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> 0xA, 0o11, 0b110
(10, 9, 6)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To convert decimal integers to these other bases, you can use Pythonâ€™s built-in functions:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> hex(10), oct(9), bin(6)
('0xa', '0o11', '0b110')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>These functions return strings formatted with the appropriate base prefix. To convert a string representation of
        a number back into an integer, use the built-in <code>int</code> function and specify the base:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> int('0xA', 16)
10</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        A large value such as 9,999,999 is easier to read when written with commas to group digits. As of Python 3.6,
        numeric literals in Python can contain underscores to group digits together, making them easier to read. These
        underscores do not change the value of the literal.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> 9_999_999
9999999</code></pre>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Strings"><b>Strings</b></span>

    <p>
        Python strings are categorized as immutable sequences, meaning that the characters they contain have a
        left-to-right positional order and cannot be changed in place.
        <br><br>
        Escape sequences let us embed characters that cannot be easily inserted into a string literal. The character
        <code>\</code>,
        along with one or more characters following it in the string literal, is replaced with a single character in the
        resulting string object.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'a\nb'
>>> print(x)
a
b</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        File paths usually contain backslashes. This can cause problems when you try to open the file, as Python
        interprets those backslashes as escape characters. To avoid this problem, you can use the letter <code>r</code>
        before the
        string to tell Python to treat the backslashes as literal characters.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> path = r"C:\new\test.dat"</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can use Pythonâ€™s built-in <code>ord</code> function to convert a single character into its corresponding
        Unicode code point (an integer).
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> ord('A')
65</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To do the reverse, that is, convert a Unicode code point back to a character, use the <code>chr</code> function.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> chr(65)
'A'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can concatenate strings using the <code>+</code> operator and repeat them
        using the <code>*</code> operator. The meaning of an operator depends on the types of objects being processed.
        This is known as polymorphism, which we will discuss later.
        However, Python does not allow combining numbers and strings using the <code>+</code> operator; doing so will
        result in a
        <code>TypeError</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Slicing lets you get a part of a sequence, like a string, using two numbers separated by a colon: start:end.
        The first number is the starting index (included), and the second is the ending index (not included).
        Python returns a new object with the items in that range.
        If you leave out the start index, it defaults to 0. If you leave out the end index, it defaults to the length of
        the sequence.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abcdef'
>>> x[0], x[-2], x[1:3], x[1:], x[:-1]
('a', 'e', 'bc', 'bcdef', 'abcde')</code></pre>
    <p>

    <p>
        You can also add a third number, like this: start:end:step. This is called the step or stride. By default, the
        step is 1 (go one item at a time).
        But you can use it to skip items (e.g., every other item) or even go backward by using a negative step.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abcdef'
>>> x[::2]
'ace'
>>> x[::-1]
'fedcba'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the slicing expression <code>x[::-1]</code>, the first two bounds can be
        thought of as defaulting to <code>len(x)-1</code> and <code>-1</code>.
    </p>


    <p>
        You can get an IndexError when you try to access a character in a string using its positional index if the index
        does not exist. But with slicing, out-of-range indexes are automatically adjusted to stay within bounds.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abc'
>>> x[1:100]
'bc'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since strings are an immutable sequence, they cannot be changed in place by assigning to an index.
        This results in a <code>TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</code>.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abc'
>>> x[0] = 'd'</code></pre>
    </p>


    <p>
        To modify a string in Python, you generally need to create a new string using techniques such as concatenation
        or slicing, and then assign the result back to the original variable. Since strings are immutable, any operation
        that appears to modify a string actually returns a new string object. String methods also generate new string
        objects. If you want to retain these new strings, you need to assign them to variables. Python automatically
        garbage-collects old, unused string objects.
        <br><br>
        Methods are functions that are associated with and operate on objects. Consider the following method call
        expression:
    <pre class="plain"><code>object.method(arguments)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        This expression is evaluated from left to right. Python retrieves the method associated with the object, then
        calls it, passing in both the object and the provided arguments. If the method returns a result, that result
        becomes the value of the entire method-call expression.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some of the most frequently used string methods. I have not covered the edge cases, so make sure to be
        aware of them to avoid unexpected behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>upper</code> method returns the string in uppercase:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abc'
>>> x.upper()
'ABC'</code></pre>
    </p>


    <p>
        The <code>lower</code> method returns the string in lowercase:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'ABC'
>>> x.lower()
'abc'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>strip</code> method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end of a string:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abc '
>>> x.strip()
'abc'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>replace</code> method replaces a substring with another string:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abc'
>>> x.replace('a', 'd')
'dbc'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>split</code> method divides a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = "1, 2, 3"
>>> x.split(",")
['1', ' 2', ' 3']</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 and allow for clean, concise string formatting.
        To specify a string as an f-string, simply put <code>f</code> in front of the string literal,
        and use curly brackets <code>{}</code> as placeholders:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'd'
>>> y = f'abc{x}'
>>> y
'abcd'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The expressions inside <code>{}</code> are evaluated at runtime, using the current values of the variables or
        expressions they contain.
        A placeholder can include variables, operations, function calls, and formatting modifiers.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'd'
>>> f'abc{x.upper()}'
'abcD'
>>> x = 2
>>> f'{x:.2f}'
'2.00'
>>> f'The result is {2 * 5}'
'The result is 10'</code></pre>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Booleans"><b>Booleans</b></span>

    <p>
        Python comes with Booleans with predefined <code>True</code> and
        <code>False</code> objects that are essentially just the integers 1 and 0
        with custom display logic.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> True + 1
2</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        It also has a special placeholder object called <code>None</code>, which is commonly
        used to initialize names and objects and designate the absence of a result in functions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python provides a <code>bool</code> built-in function that can be used to extract the Boolean
        value of an object. You can use this to explicitly check if an object is true, that is,
        nonzero or nonempty.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> bool(1)
True
>>> bool(0)
False
>>> bool('abc')
True
>>> bool('')
False</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        Comparison operators are used to compare values. For numbers, they work exactly as you'd expect. These operators
        include: Equal to (<code>==</code>), Not equal to (<code>!=</code>), Less than (<code>&lt;</code>), Greater than
        (<code>&gt;</code>), Less than or equal to (<code>&lt;=</code>), and
        Greater than or equal to (<code>&gt;=</code>).
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> 10 > 9
True
>>> 10 == 9
False
>>> 10 &lt; 9
False</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the following code. The result is <code>False</code> because floating-point numbers in Python cannot
        represent decimal values exactly
        due to precision limitations.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> 1.1 + 2.2 == 3.3
False
>>> 1.1 + 2.2
3.3000000000000003
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To handle this issue, you can use the <code>isclose()</code> method from the <code>math</code> module, which
        allows
        you to compare floating-point numbers with a tolerance for small errors:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> import math
>>> math.isclose(1.1 + 2.2, 3.3)
True
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, the <code>Decimal</code> class from the <code>decimal</code> module can be used for precise
        decimal
        arithmetic. It provides an exact representation of decimal numbers, avoiding the rounding issues associated with
        floats:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> from decimal import Decimal
>>> Decimal('1.1') + Decimal('2.2') == Decimal('3.3')
True
</code></pre>
    </p>


    <p>
        When comparing different types, Python will attempt to convert values to a common type before making the
        comparison. For example, comparing an integer with a float will
        convert the integer to a float before performing the comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python has three Boolean operators: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.
        These operators always return an object, either the object on the left side of the operator
        or the object on the right.
        The <code>and</code> operator returns the first false operand or the last operand if both are true.
        The <code>or</code> operator returns the first true operand or the last if both are false.
        The <code>not</code> operator inverts the truth value.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> {} and []
{}
>>> {} and 4
{}
>>> 3 and 4
4
>>> 3 or 4
3
>>> {} or []
[]
>>> not 3
False</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The net result of all this is that you get a value that is logically true or false when tested in an
        <code>if</code> or <code>while</code> statement, according to the normal definition of <code>or</code> and
        <code>and</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python allows for chained comparisons. For example, the expression <code>X &lt; Y &lt; Z</code> is equivalent to
        <code>X &lt; Y and Y &lt; Z</code>. It's best to avoid this and be as explicit as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Python, there are two primary ways to compare objects: the <code>==</code> operator and the <code>is</code>
        operator. The <code>==</code> operator
        tests for equality, checking whether the values of two objects are the same by comparing all parts of compound
        objects and their nested components, from left to right, until a difference is found. On the other hand, the
        <code>is</code>
        operator tests for object identity, verifying whether two names point to the exact same object in memory,
        essentially checking if they occupy the same address.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> L1 = [1, ('a', 3)]
>>> L2 = [1, ('a', 3)]
>>> L1 == L2, L1 is L2
(True, False)
>>> L1 = [1, ('a', 3)]
>>> L2 = [1, ('a', 2)]
>>> L1 &lt; L2
False</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You need to be careful, as Python internally caches and reuses certain objects
        for optimization purposes. For example:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 256
>>> y = 256
>>> x is y
True</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>getrefcount</code> function can help explore this behavior by showing how many references an object
        has.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Lists"><b>Lists</b></span>



    <p>
        Lists are sequences and support many of the same operations as strings.
        <br>
        The <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> operators represent concatenation and repetition, respectively.
        Indexing and slicing work the same way.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, lists are mutable, meaning they support operations that modify
        a list object in place. To illustrate this point, consider the following code:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = x
>>> x[0] = 4
>>> y
[4, 2, 3]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        One might expect that the last assignment does not affect <code>y</code>, as it still refers to the old object.
        This is not the case. We have changed a component of the object <code>x</code> refers to. This overwrites the
        value in place, so it affects <code>y</code> because it refers to the same object.
        <br><br>
        If you don't want this, you can make a copy of the object. There are multiple ways to do this, one of which is:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = x[:]
>>> x[0] = 4
>>> y
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p> When using a list, you can modify its contents by assigning a new value to a specific item or to a range (slice)
        of items. The length of the sequence being assigned does not need to match the length of the slice being
        replaced. Slice assignment can be used to replace, expand, or shrink the subject list.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3] 
>>> x[1:2] = [4, 5] 
>>> x 
[1, 4, 5, 3] 
>>> x[1:1] = [6, 7] 
>>> x 
[1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 3] 
>>> x[1:2] = [] 
>>> x 
[1, 7, 4, 5, 3]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Like strings, Python list objects also support type-specific method calls,
        most of which modify the list itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>insert</code> method can be used to insert items at a specified location without replacing any of the
        existing items.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> x.insert(2, 5)
>>> x
[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To add an item to the end of the list, use the <code>append</code> method.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x.append(4)
>>> x
[1, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To append elements from another list to the current list, use the <code>extend</code> method.
        The elements will be added to the end of the list.
        The <code>extend</code> method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5]
>>> x.extend(y)
>>> x
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>remove</code> method removes the specified item.
        If there are more than one item with the specified value, then the method removes the first occurrence.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 1, 2, 3]
>>> x.remove(1)
>>> x
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>pop</code> method removes and returns the item from the specified index.
        If no index is specified, then it removes the last item.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> x.pop(2)
3
>>> x
[1, 2, 4]
>>> x.pop()
4
>>> x
[1, 2]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>del</code> keyword also removes an item from a specified index. The syntax is different.
        You can also use it to delete the entire list.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> del x[2]
>>> x
[1, 2, 4]
>>> del x</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>clear</code> method empties the list but it does not delete it.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x.clear()
>>> x
[]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        List objects have a <code>sort</code> method that sorts the list alphanumerically, ascending by default.
        Just make sure that the items are of the same data type.
        <br>
        To sort in descending order, use the keyword argument <code>reverse=True</code>.
        Alternatively, one can use the <code>reverse</code> method.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [3, 1, 2]
>>> x.sort()
>>> x
[1, 2, 3]
>>> x.sort(reverse=True)
>>> x
[3, 2, 1]
>>> x.reverse()
>>> x
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also sort based on a function by using the keyword argument <code>key = function</code>.
        The function will return a value for each item in the list, by which the list will be sorted.
        The <code>sort</code> method is case-sensitive. To avoid unexpected results you can use <code>str.lower</code>
        as a key function.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def myfunc(n):
...     return abs(n - 50)
... 
>>> x = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
>>> x.sort(key=myfunc)
>>> x
[50, 65, 23, 82, 100]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of using slice syntax, you can also use the <code>copy</code> method or the
        <code>list</code> constructor.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = list(x)
>>> z = x.copy()
>>> y, z
([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If a collection object contains a reference to itself, it is called a cyclic object.
        Python prints a <code>[...] </code> whenever it detects a cycle in the object back to itself, rather than
        getting stuck in an infinite loop.
        Cyclic structures may cause code of your own to fall into unexpected loops if you don't anticipate them.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> L = ['a']
>>> L.append(L)
>>> L
['a', [...]]
>>> L[1]
['a', [...]]
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="Tuples"><b>Tuples</b></span>

    <p>
        Tuples, like strings, are immutable sequences. There are certain
        peculiarities one must be aware of when working with them. For example,
        if you want a single-item tuple, you need to add a trailing comma:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = (2)
>>> x
2
>>> x = (2,)
>>> x
(2,)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Python allows you to omit the opening and closing round brackets for a tuple
        where it is not ambiguous to do so:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 2, 3, 4
>>> x
(2, 3, 4)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Tuples don't provide the same methods as strings, lists, or
        dictionaries. For example, there is no built-in <code>append</code> method.
        A workaround for modifying a tuple is to convert it into a list, make your changes,
        and then convert it back into a tuple using the <code>tuple</code> constructor.
        The immutability of tuples provides some integrity; you can be sure that
        a tuple won't be changed elsewhere in a program unintentionally.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Sets"><b>Sets</b></span>

    <p>Python sets are unordered collections of unique and immutable (hashable) elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets
        do not allow duplicates and do not maintain any order. You can create a set using the built-in <code>set</code>
        function
        with any iterable, or with curly-brace (<code>{}</code>) literals.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> A = set('abc')
>>> B = {'d', 'e', 'f'}
>>> A, B
({'c', 'a', 'b'}, {'e', 'd', 'f'})</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Sets support fast membership testing and standard set operations like union, intersection, difference, subset
        and superset checks:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> B = {2, 4, 5, 6}
>>> A & B
{2, 4}
>>> A | B
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
>>> A - B
{1, 3}
>>> A > B
False</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Sets are especially handy for eliminating duplicates, comparing collections regardless of order, or checking
        what's missing or extra:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> list(set([1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))
[1, 2, 3]
>>> set('learn') - set('ear')
{'n', 'l'}
>>> set('note') == set('tone')
True</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Regular sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove items using methods like <code>add</code> and
        <code>remove</code>.
        However, the elements themselves must be immutable. You can use the <code>update</code> method to add items
        from an iterable object.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Dictionaries"><b>Dictionaries</b></span>

    <p>Dictionaries are key-based collections of objects. Items are stored and retrieved using keys, rather than by
        positional index as in lists. Internally, dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.
    </p>

    <p> When you assign a new key to a dictionary, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary. This differs from
        lists, where you can only assign values to existing indices. Dictionary keys are not limited to strings; any
        immutable object (such as numbers, strings, or tuples) can be used as a key.
    </p>

    <p>As of Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve the insertion order of keys as an implementation detail, and this
        behavior became an official part of the Python language specification in Python 3.8.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 3: 'c'}
>>> D
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 3: 'c'}
>>> D['e'] = 4
>>> D
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 3: 'c', 'e': 4}
>>> D = {'a' : 1, 'a': 2}
>>> D
{'a': 2}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can build dictionaries using the <code>dict</code> constructor.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = dict(a = 1, b = 2)
>>> x
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Dictionary methods <code>keys</code>, <code>values</code>, and <code>items</code> return iterable objects
        containing keys, values, and (key,
        value) pairs, respectively, which can be used in loops or converted to lists for display. Any changes made to
        the dictionary will be reflected accordingly.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = {'a' : 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
>>> list(x.keys())
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> list(x.values())
[1, 2, 3]
>>> list(x.items())
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> x['d'] = 4
>>> list(x.keys())
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Fetching a nonexistent key is normally an error, but the <code>get</code>
        method returns a default value, <code>None</code>, or a passed-in default if the key
        doesn't exist.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> D = {'a' : 1}
>>> D.get('b')
>>> D.get('b', 2)
2</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>update</code> method merges the keys and values of one
        dictionary into another, both adding new entries for new keys and blindly
        overwriting values of existing keys if there's a clash. The dictionary's <code>pop</code>
        method deletes a key from the dictionary and returns the value it had, similar to other
        <code>pop</code> methods.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> D.update({'c': 3})
>>> D
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
>>> D.pop('a')
1
>>> D
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="ifMatch"><b>If and Match Selections</b></span>

    <p>
        All Python compound statements, statements that have other statements nested inside them, follow the same
        general pattern of a header line terminated in a colon, followed by a nested block of code usually indented
        underneath the header line, like this:
    <pre class="plain"><code>Header line:
	Nested statement block</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other
        programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose. Consider the following code: Python evaluates
        the condition inside an <code>if</code> statement and runs the appropriate code based on whether the condition
        is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 33
>>> b = 200
>>> if b > 0:
...     print('b is greater than a')
... 
b is greater than a</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>elif</code> keyword in Python stands for else if.
        It allows you to check a new condition if the previous <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code> conditions were not
        true. You can use multiple <code>elif</code> statements to test several different conditions in sequence.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 33
>>> b = 33
>>> if b > a:
...     print('b is greater than a')
... elif a == b:
...     print('a and b are equal')
... 
a and b are equal</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>else</code> keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 200
>>> b = 33
>>> if b > a:
...     print('b is greater than a')
... elif a == b:
...     print('a and b are equal')
... else:
...     print('a is greater than b')
... 
a is greater than b</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
... 
a is greater than b</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have only one statement to execute, one for <code>if</code>,
        and one for <code>else</code>, you can put it all on the same line:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 2
>>> b = 330
>>> print("A") if a > b else print("B")
B</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also have multiple <code>else</code> statements on the same line.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 330
>>> b = 330
>>> print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
=</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>match</code> statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Instead of
        writing many if/else statements, you can use the match statement. The <code>match</code> statement selects one
        of many code blocks to be executed. Here's how it works: the match expression is evaluated once. The value of
        the expression is then compared with the values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code
        is executed.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> day = 2
>>> match day:
...     case 1:
...             print('Monday')
...     case 2:
...             print('Tuesday')
... 
Tuesday</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can use the underscore character <code>_</code> as a fallback case when no other match is found, similar to
        a default case. It will always match, so it should be placed at the end of the <code>match</code> statement.
        To check for multiple values in a single case, use the pipe character <code>|</code> as an <code>OR</code>
        operator.
        You can also include an <code>if</code> condition in a case to apply additional checks.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="whileFor"><b>While and For Loops</b></span>

    <p>
        <code>while</code> statement repeatedly executes an associated block
        of statements as long as a test at the top keeps evaluating to a
        true value.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 0; b = 10
>>> while a &lt; b:
...     print(a, end=' ')
...     a += 1
... 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements control the flow inside a <code>while</code> loop.
        They can be placed anywhere within the loop's body, but are often used inside <code>if</code> statements to
        react to specific conditions.
        <code>break</code> exits the nearest enclosing loop immediately, skipping any remaining code in the loop
        body.
        <code>continue</code> skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps back to the loopâ€™s condition check.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 0; b = 10
>>> while a &lt; b:
...     if a == 3:
...         a += 1
...         continue
...     if a == 8:
...         break
...     print(a, end=' ')
...     a += 1
... 
0 1 2 4 5 6 7 </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>else</code> statement can be used with a <code>while</code> loop to run a block of code once after the
        loop condition becomes false, but only if the loop was not exited using a <code>break</code>.

    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> a = 0
>>> while a &lt; 5:
...     print(a, end=' ')
...     a += 1
... else:
...     print('Loop finished normally')
... 
0 1 2 3 4 Loop finished normally</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>pass</code> statement is a no-operation placeholder. It is roughly to
        statements what <code>None</code> is to objects. For example:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> while True:
...     pass
... </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The Python <code>for</code> loop starts with a header line that specifies an assignment target (or targets),
        along with the iterable object you want to step through. This header is followed by a block of indented
        statements that you want to execute repeatedly.

        When Python runs a <code>for</code> loop, it assigns each item from the iterable to the target variable, one by
        one, and executes the loop body for each item.

        The <code>for</code> loop also supports an optional <code>else</code> block, which works the same way as in a
        <code>while</code> loop.

        The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements also behave the same in a <code>for</code> loop as
        they
        do in a <code>while</code> loop.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> for x in [1, 2, 3]:
...     print(x, end=' ')
... 
1 2 3
>>> for (x, y) in [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]:
...     print(x, y)
... 
1 2
3 4
5 6</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The built-in functions <code>range</code>, <code>zip</code>, and <code>enumerate</code>
        allow you to write more powerful and flexible loop iterations in Python.
    </p>

    <p>
        With one argument, <code>range</code> generates a series of integers starting from zero up to, but not
        including, the specified value.
        With two arguments, the first argument acts as the inclusive lower bound, and the second argument as the
        exclusive upper bound.
        With three arguments, the third argument specifies the step, which defaults to +1.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> list(range(5))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> list(range(2, 5))
[2, 3, 4]
>>> list(range(1, 5, 2))
[1, 3]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>zip</code> function can take one or more sequence arguments (more generally, any type of iterable
        object) and returns an iterator
        that produces tuples, each containing elements from the corresponding positions in the input sequences.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> y = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> list(zip(x, y))
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>enumerate</code> function takes an iterable and returns an iterator that produces
        tuples, where each tuple contains the index and the corresponding item from the iterable.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 'abcd'
>>> list(enumerate(x))
[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'd')]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Functions"><b>Functions</b></span>

    <p>
        In Python, functions are defined using the <code>def</code> keyword. When Python encounters a <code>def</code>
        statement, it creates a function object and assigns it to the function's name, allowing the function to be
        referenced, assigned to variables, or stored in collections. The code inside the function doesn't run until the
        function is called, and <code>def</code> statements themselves are not executed until reached. Functions in
        Python can also have custom attributes attached to them to store additional data. The <code>return</code>
        statement, which can appear anywhere in the function body, ends the function call and sends a result back to the
        caller. If no value is specified with <code>return</code>, Python returns <code>None</code> by default.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def adder(x, y):
...     return x + y
... 
>>> myfunc = adder
>>> myfunc(2, 3)
5</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Names assigned inside a function using <code>def</code> are local to that function and can only be accessed
        within its scope. These names are not visible outside the function, meaning you can't refer to them from outside
        the function body. Additionally, names defined inside a function don't interfere with variables in other scopes,
        even if the same name is used. This behavior is governed by Python's LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in)
        rule, which dictates the order in which Python looks for a variable.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = 300
>>> def myfunc():
...     x = 200
...     return x
... 
>>> myfunc()
200
>>> x
300</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you need to create a global variable but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the <code>global</code>
        keyword.
        The <code>global</code> keyword makes the variable global. Additionally, use the <code>global</code> keyword if
        you want to modify a
        global variable inside a function.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def myfunc():
...     global x
...     x = 300
... 
>>> myfunc()

    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>nonlocal</code> keyword is used to work with variables inside nested
        functions. The <code>nonlocal</code> keyword makes the variable belong to the outer
        function.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def myfunc1():
...     x = 1
...     def myfunc2():
...             nonlocal x
...             x = 2
...     myfunc2()
...     return x
... 
>>> myfunc1()
2</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p> To understand how argument passing works in Python, let's examine the following code: Inside the function
        <code>f</code>, the variable <code>a</code> is assigned the value <code>1</code>. However, this change only
        affects the variable <code>a</code> within the function itself, and does not impact the value of <code>b</code>
        outside the function. This is because Python uses pass-by-assignment (also called
        pass-by-object-reference). When a variable is passed into a function, what actually gets passed is a reference
        to the object, not the object itself. If the object is reassigned within the function (like <code>a = 1</code>),
        it doesn't affect the original variable outside the function.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def f(a):
...     a = 1
... 
>>> b = 2
>>> f(b)
>>> b
2</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        However, when arguments are passed as mutable objects like lists and dictionaries, changes made in-place to such
        objects may live on after a function exits.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def f(a):
...     a[0] = 2
... 
>>> b = [1, 4, 6]
>>> f(b)
>>> b
[2, 4, 6]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't want in-place changes to impact the objects you pass, you can simply make explicit copies of
        mutable
        objects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python matches names by <i>position</i> from left to right. In the following, <code>a</code> is matched to
        <code>1</code>, <code>b</code> is matched to <code>2</code>, and so on. Keyword arguments allow you to match by
        <i>name</i>, instead of by position. You can even combine positional and keyword arguments in a single call. In
        this case, all positionals are matched first from left to right in the definition, before keywords are matched
        by name.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def f(a, b, c):
...     print(a, b, c)
... 
>>> f(1, 2, 3)
1 2 3
>>> def f(a, b, c):
...     print(a, b, c)
... 
>>> f(1, 2, 3)
1 2 3
>>> f(c = 1, b = 3, a = 2)
2 3 1</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Defaults allow you to make selected function arguments <i>optional</i>. If not
        passed by value, the argument is assigned its default. You can also combine keywords and defaults.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> f(c = 1, b = 3, a = 2)
2 3 1
>>> def f(a, b = 2, c = 3):
...     print(a, b, c)
... 
>>> f(1)
1 2 3
>>> f(5, 4, 3)
5 4 3</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The argument-matching extensions <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> are
        designed to support any number of arguments. They can appear in function definitions and function calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a function is called, Python collects all the positional arguments into a new tuple and assigns the
        variable <code>args</code> to that tuple.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def f(*args):
...     print(args)
... 
>>> f()
()
>>> f(1)
(1,)
>>> f(1, 2, 3)
(1, 2, 3)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>**kwargs</code> syntax is similar, but it collects keyword arguments into a new dictionary.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def f(**kwargs):
...     print(kwargs)
... 
>>> f()
{}
>>> f(a = 1, b = 2)
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can combine regular arguments, <code>*args</code>, and <code>**kwargs</code> to create flexible function
        signatures. For example, in the following:
        <code>1</code> is passed to <code>a</code> by position, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> are collected into the
        <code>pargs</code> tuple, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are collected into the <code>kargs</code>
        dictionary.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def f(a, *args, **kwargs):
...     print(a, args, kwargs)
... 
>>> f(1, 2, 3, x = 1, y = 2)
1 (2, 3) {'x': 1, 'y': 2}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>*</code> syntax can be used when calling a function to unpack a collection of arguments, such as a
        tuple or any other iterable, into individual positional arguments. For example, you can pass a tuple with four
        arguments to a function, and Python will unpack them into separate arguments.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def func(a, b, c):
...     print(a, b, c)
... 
>>> func(*(1, 2, 3))
1 2 3</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, the <code>**</code> syntax can be used to unpack a dictionary into key-value pairs, where the
        dictionary keys are used as argument names (keywords) and the values are passed as the corresponding argument
        values.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def func(a, b, c):
...     print(a, b, c)
... 
>>> func(**{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})
1 2 3</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Starting from Python 3.5, it is possible to use multiple <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> items in function
        calls to unpack multiple iterables and mappings. The <code>*</code> unpacks positional arguments, while
        <code>**</code> unpacks keyword arguments. However, note that <code>*</code> must appear before <code>**</code>
        when used together, as per Python's formal argument-passing rules. There are some other peculiarities that we
        might discuss later.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def func(a, b, c, d, e, f):
...     print(a, b, c, d, e, f)
... 
>>> func(1, *(2, 3, 4), **{'e': 5, 'f': 6})
1 2 3 4 5 6</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can specify that a function can have only positional arguments by adding <code>/</code> after the positional
        arguments. To specify that a function can have only keyword arguments, add <code>*</code> before the arguments.
        These two types of arguments can be combined in the same function. Any argument before the <code>/</code> is
        positional-only, and any argument after the <code>*</code> is keyword-only.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def func(a, b, /, c, *, d):
...     print(a, b, c, d)
... 
>>> func(1, 2, c = 3, d = 4)
1 2 3 4
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="Lambdas"><b>Lambdas</b></span>

    <p>
        A lambda function is a small, anonymous function.
        A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression. The result of that
        expression is automatically returned.
        Syntax: <code>lambda arguments: expression</code>
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = lambda a: a + 10
>>> x(5)
15
>>> x = lambda a, b: a*b
>>> x(5, 6)
30</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The power of lambdas is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.
        Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown
        number.
        Use that function definition to make a function that always doubles or triples the number you send in.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def func(n):
...     return lambda a: a*n
... 
>>> double = func(2)
>>> double(11)
22
>>> triple = func(3)
>>> triple(9)
27</code></pre>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <span id="Comprehensions"><b>Comprehensions</b></span>

    <p> List comprehensions can be used to build a new list by applying an expression to each item in a sequence or,
        more generally, any iterable. Similarly, set comprehensions create a set, which automatically removes
        duplicates.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> L = [x*2 for x in 'abc'] 
>>> L 
['aa', 'bb', 'cc'] 
>>> S = {x*2 for x in 'abc'} 
>>> S 
{'aa', 'cc', 'bb'}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p> Comprehensions also support extensions such as <code>if</code> filters and nested <code>for</code> loops. </p>
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> L = [x*2 for x in 'abc' if x >= 'b'] 
>>> L 
['bb', 'cc'] 
>>> [x + y for x in 'abc' for y in '123'] 
['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3']</code></pre>

    <p>
        Dictionary comprehensions run an implicit loop, collecting the key/value
        results of expressions on each iteration and using them to fill out a new dictionary.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> D = {x: x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3]}
>>> D
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
>>> D = {x: x*4 for x in 'abc'}
>>> D
{'a': 'aaaa', 'b': 'bbbb', 'c': 'cccc'}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="Generators"><b>Generators</b></span>

    <p>
        Generator functions look like regular <code>def</code> functions, but instead of using
        <code>return</code>, they employ <code>yield</code> to produce values one at a time.
        Each call to the generator resumes execution right where it left off, preserving its state.
        Generator expressions, meanwhile, resemble list comprehensions, but instead of creating an
        entire list in memory, they return an iterator that generates values on demand.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following defines a generator function that produces the squares of a sequence of numbers. It returns a
        <i>generator object</i> which follows the iteration protocol. This object has a <code>__next__</code> method
        that either starts the function or resumes execution from the point where the last <code>yield</code> was
        encountered.
        When the sequence is exhausted, it raises a <code>StopIteration</code> exception.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def gensquares(n):
...     for i in range(n):
...         yield i**2
...
>>> x = gensquares(3)
>>> x
<generator object gensquares at 0x10649b610>
>>> next(x)
0
>>> next(x)
1
>>> next(x)
4
>>> next(x)
StopIteration</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        A <i>generator expression</i> is a concise way to create a generator object without the need for defining a
        separate
        function. It is similar to a list comprehension but instead of returning a full list, it returns a generator
        object
        that yields values one at a time, which can be more memory-efficient. The syntax consists of an expression
        followed
        by a <code>for</code> clause, and optionally an <code>if</code> clause.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> squares = (i**2 for i in range(3))
>>> squares
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x106a1f060>
>>> next(squares)
0
>>> next(squares)
1
>>> next(squares)
4
>>> next(squares)
StopIteration</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="Modules"><b>Modules</b></span>

    <p>
        A module in Python is simply a file with the extension <code>.py</code> that contains code such as functions,
        variables, or classes. When a file is imported, Python creates a module object, and all names defined at the top
        level of the file become attributes of this object. These attributes can then be accessed and used by other
        code.
    </p>

    <p>For example, if we have a file called <code>mymodule.py</code> with the following code:</p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>def printer(x):
    print(x)
</code></pre>

    <p>we can import it and use it like this:</p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> import mymodule
>>> mymodule.printer("Hello")
Hello
</code></pre>

    <p>
        In this example, the name <code>mymodule</code> identifies the file <code>mymodule.py</code>, but it also
        becomes a variable in the importing script that refers to the module object itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        The standard <code>import</code> statement brings the entire module object into the current scope. This means we
        must always use the module name as a prefix to access its contents, such as <code>mymodule.printer</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        An alternative form is the <code>from ... import ...</code> statement, which copies specific names directly into
        the importing scope. For instance:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>from mymodule import printer
printer("Hello")
</code></pre>

    <p>
        In this case, we can use the function name directly without qualifying it with the module name. However, note
        that the module itself (<code>mymodule</code>) is not imported as a name in this form.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is also the <code>from module import *</code> form, which copies all top-level names from the module into
        the importing scope:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>from mymodule import *
printer("Hello")
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This can reduce typing but often leads to name clashes and less readable code, so it is usually discouraged in
        larger projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Regardless of which syntax is used, both <code>import</code> and <code>from</code> statements trigger the same
        underlying import process. A module is located, compiled to bytecode if needed, and executed once, from top to
        bottom. After the first import, the module object is stored in Pythonâ€™s internal module cache
        (<code>sys.modules</code>). Later imports of the same file simply reuse this cached object rather than executing
        the code again.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, suppose we have the following file called <code>init.py</code>:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>print("hello")
flag = 1
</code></pre>

    <p>
        When we import this module the first time, the statements inside it are executed:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> import init
hello
>>> init.flag
1
</code></pre>

    <p>
        If we change a value and import the module again, the code is not rerun and the object from the cache is reused:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> init.flag = 2
>>> import init
>>> init.flag
2
</code></pre>

    <p>
        If we do want the code to run again, we can use the <code>reload</code> function from the <code>importlib</code>
        module:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>import importlib
importlib.reload(init)
</code></pre>

    <p>
        Because <code>import</code> and <code>from</code> are executable statements rather than compile-time
        declarations, they may appear inside conditionals, functions, or even <code>try</code> blocks. For example, one
        might import different modules depending on a condition:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>if use_a:
    from moduleA import name
else:
    from moduleB import name
</code></pre>

    <p>
        In this case, the chosen module is only imported when execution reaches that branch of code.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is an important difference between importing names with <code>from</code> and using a regular
        <code>import</code>. When you use <code>from</code>, the names are copied into your scope, but there is no live
        link back to the original module. For instance:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>from share import x
x = 23        # changes my local x only, not share.x
</code></pre>

    <p>
        If instead you use <code>import share</code>, you can modify the names inside the module object directly:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>import share
share.x = 23  # changes x inside share
</code></pre>

    <p>
        Mutable objects behave differently, however. If <code>y</code> is a list defined in <code>share</code>, then
        both
        <code>y</code> in your script and <code>share.y</code> reference the same list object:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>from share import y
y[0] = 99     # modifies the list in both places
</code></pre>

    <p>
        A <code>from</code> statement such as <code>from module import name1, name2</code> is conceptually equivalent to
        first importing the module, then assigning its names into the current scope, and finally discarding the module
        name:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>import module
name1 = module.name1
name2 = module.name2
del module
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This means that the module is always fully loaded into memory even if you only import one or two names. Python
        does not support partially loading only a single function from a file. Fortunately, because modules are bytecode
        rather than heavy machine code, this design choice rarely causes performance issues in practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Internally, a moduleâ€™s namespace is stored as a dictionary. You can access it with the moduleâ€™s
        <code>__dict__</code> attribute. The keys of this dictionary are the variable and function names defined in the
        module, along with some special system-defined names such as <code>__name__</code> and <code>__file__</code>.
        For example:
    <pre
        class="plain"><code>>>> mymodule.__dict__.keys()
dict_keys(['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__', '__loader__', '__spec__', '__file__', '__cached__', '__builtins__', 'printer'])</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To find out whatâ€™s available in a module, such as the standard libraryâ€™s <code>sys</code>, import it and pass it
        to <code>dir</code>.
        To find out what attributes are provided in objects of built-in types, run <code>dir</code> on a literal, an
        existing instance, or the name of the desired type.
    </p>

    <span id="ClassesOOP"><b>Classes and OOP</b></span>

    <p>
        Classes in Python allow us to define custom objects with specific behavior and data.
        In Python's object-oriented programming model, there are two main types of objects: class
        objects and instance objects.
        Class objects act as blueprints for creating instance objects.
        <br><br>
        A <code>class</code> statement defines a class object and assigns it a name.
        Any assignments made within the <code>class</code> body become class attributes.
        <br><br>
        When you call a class object like a function, it creates a new instance object.
        This instance inherits the class's attributes but also has its own independent namespace.
        Inside class methods, the first parameter, conventionally named <code>self</code>, refers to the instance being
        operated on.
        Assigning attributes to <code>self</code> creates or updates instance-specific data, without affecting the class
        itself.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> class FirstClass:
...     def setdata(self, value):
...             self.data = value
...     def display(self):
...             print(self.data)
... </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Calling a class like a function creates a new instance object. Each instance
        starts with its own empty namespace, inherits attributes from its class and
        gets its own instance attributes via assignments to <code>self</code> inside methods.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = FirstClass()
>>> y = FirstClass()
>>> x.setdata("coding")
>>> y.setdata(3.14)
>>> x.display()
coding
>>> y.display()
3.14
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Classes can be specialized by creating subclasses that inherit from superclasses.
        A subclass is defined with parentheses: <code>class Sub(Base): ...</code>, a subclass overrides
        attributes/methods
        of its superclass and attribute lookup goes: <i>instance â†’ class â†’ superclasses</i>.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> class SecondClass(FirstClass):
...     def display(self):
...             print(f'Current value = {self.data}')
... 
>>> z = SecondClass()
>>> z.setdata("Hello")
>>> z.display()
Current value = Hello</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Operator overloading in Python allows classes to intercept and define custom behavior for built-in operators by
        using specially named methods. For example, the <code>__init__</code> method acts as a constructor and is
        automatically
        called when a new instance of the class is created. The <code>__str__</code> method determines how an object is
        represented
        as a string when printed. Similarly, the <code>__add__</code> method defines the behavior of the <code>+</code>
        operator, enabling
        objects of the class to be added together using customized logic.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> class ThirdClass(SecondClass):
...     def __init__(self, value):
...         self.data = value
...     def __add__(self, other):
...         return ThirdClass(self.data + other)
...     def __str__(self):
...         return f"[ThirdClass: {self.data}]"
...     def mul(self, other):
...         self.data *= other  # in-place
... 
>>> a = ThirdClass(3)
>>> print(a)
[ThirdClass: 3]
>>> b = a + 4
>>> print(b)
[ThirdClass: 7]
>>> a.mul(5)
>>> print(a)
[ThirdClass: 15]
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        A class can be completely empty, used as a record-like container:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> class rec: pass
... 
>>> rec.name = 'Pat'
>>> rec.age = 40
>>> print(rec.name)
Pat</code></pre>
    </p>


    <p>
        Instances inherit class attributes but can also have their own:
    </p>

    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = rec()
>>> y = rec()
>>> x.name = 'Sue'
>>> print(rec.name, x.name, y.name)
Pat Sue Pat</code></pre>

    <p>
        In Python, both classes and instances store their attributes in dictionaries internally.
        You can access these dictionaries through the <code>__dict__</code> attribute:
        For example:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> rec.__dict__ 
>>> x.__dict__ </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Classes can serve as records, often more structured than dictionaries:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> class Person:
...     def __init__(self, name, jobs, age=None):
...             self.name = name
...             self.jobs = jobs
...             self.age = age
...     def info(self):
...             return (self.name, self.jobs)
... 
>>> rec1 = Person('Bob', ['dev', 'mgr'], 40)
>>> rec2 = Person('Sue', ['dev', 'cto'])
>>> print(rec1.jobs, rec2.info())
['dev', 'mgr'] ('Sue', ['dev', 'cto'])
</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike dictionaries, classes bundle both data and logic in a reusable structure,
        and can leverage inheritance and operator overloading.

    <span id="Iterators"><b>Iterators</b></span>

    <p> It's important to understand the distinction between an <i>iterable</i> and an <i>iterator</i> in Python. An
        <i>iterable</i> is any object that implements the <code>__iter__</code> method and can return an
        <i>iterator</i>. The <i>iterator</i> is the object returned by calling <code>__iter__</code> on the iterable. An
        <i>iterator</i> implements the <code>__next__</code> method, which produces values. When there are no more
        values to produce, <code>__next__</code> raises a <code>StopIteration</code> exception.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> L = [1, 2] 
>>> I = iter(L) 
>>> next(I) 
1 
>>> next(I) 
2 
>>> next(I) 
StopIteration</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also create user-defined iterables by implementing the iteration protocol
        in a class. This means defining <code>__iter__</code> to return an iterator and
        <code>__next__</code> to produce values. For example, the class below generates squares
        on demand:
    </p>


    <p>
    <pre class="plain"><code>class Squares:
    def __init__(self, start, stop):
        self.value = start - 1
        self.stop = stop

    def __iter__(self):        
        return self

    def __next__(self):        
        if self.value == self.stop:
            raise StopIteration
        self.value += 1
        return self.value ** 2</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Instances of this class behave like built-in iterables:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> for i in Squares(1, 5):
...     print(i, end=" ")
1 4 9 16 25</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, the iterator object returned by <code>__iter__</code> is the instance itself,
        because <code>__next__</code> is part of the same class. In more complex designs,
        you might define a separate iterator class to allow multiple independent iterations
        over the same data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Manual iteration works the same way as with built-ins:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> X = Squares(1, 5)
>>> I = iter(X)
>>> next(I)
1
>>> next(I)
4
>>> next(I)
9
>>> next(I)
16
>>> next(I)
25
>>> next(I)
StopIteration</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="Exceptions"><b>Exceptions</b></span>


    <p>
        When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.
        These exceptions can be handled using the <code>try</code> statement.
        Since the <code>try</code> block raises an error, the <code>except</code> block will be executed.
        Without the <code>try</code> block, the program will crash and raise an error:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> try:
...     print(x)
... except:
...     print("An exception occurred")
... 
An exception occurred</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for
        a specific kind of error.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> try:
...     print(x)
... except NameError:
...     print("Variable x is not defined")
... except:
...     print("Something else went wrong")
... 
Variable x is not defined</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can use the <code>else</code> keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> try:
...     print('Hello')
... except:
...     print('Something went wrong')
... else:
...     print('Nothing went wrong')
... 
Hello
Nothing went wrong</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>finally</code> block, if specified, will be executed regardless of whether the <code>try</code>block
        raises an
        error or not.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> try:
...     print(x)
... except:
...     print('Something went wrong')
... finally:
...     print("The 'try except' is finished")
... 
Something went wrong
The 'try except' is finished</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        This can be useful to close objects and clean up resources.
        The program can continue, without leaving the file object open.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> try:
...     f = open('demofile.txt')
...     try:
...             f.write('Lorem Ipsum')
...     except: 
...             print('Something went wrong when writing to the file')
...     finally:
...             f.close()
... except:
...     print('Something went wrong when opening the file')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.
        To throw (or raise) an exception, use the <code>raise</code> keyword.
        You can define what kind of error to raise, and the text to print to the user.
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> x = -1
>>> if x &lt; 0:
...     raise Exception('Sorry, no numbers below zero')
... 
Exception: Sorry, no numbers below zero
>>> x = 'Hello'
>>> if not type(x) is int:
...     raise TypeError('Only integers are allowed')
... 
TypeError: Only integers are allowed</code></pre>
    </p>

    <span id="Recursion"><b>Recursion</b></span>

    <p>
        Recursion can be implemented in Python. A recursive function is
        a function that calls itself. Consider the following
        code:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def function():
...     x = 10
...     function()
... </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        When <code>function()</code> executes for the first time, Python creates a namespace and assigns <code>x</code>
        the value <code>10</code> in that namespace. Then <code>function()</code> calls itself recursively.
        The second time <code>function()</code> runs, the interpreter creates a
        new namespace and again assigns <code>10</code> to <code>x</code>.
        These two instances of the name <code>x</code> are distinct from each
        other and can coexist without clashing because they are in separate namespaces.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, running <code>function()</code> as it stands produces an error, as the following traceback shows:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> function()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in function
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in function
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in function
  [Previous line repeated 996 more times]
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        As written, <code>function()</code> would, in theory, go on forever,
        calling itself over and over without any of the calls ever
        returning. Python doesnâ€™t allow that to happen. The interpreter limits the maximum number of times a function
        can call itself recursively, and when it reaches that limit, it raises a
        <code>RecursionError</code> exception. You can find out what Pythonâ€™s recursion limit is with a function from
        the <code>sys</code> module called <code>getrecursionlimit()</code>:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> from sys import getrecursionlimit
>>> getrecursionlimit()
1000</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can change this value, but a function that calls itself recursively
        must have a plan to eventually stop. Recursive functions typically
        follow this pattern:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There are one or more base cases that are directly solvable without the need for further recursion.</li>
        <li>Each recursive call moves the solution progressively closer to a base case.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now consider the function <code>countdown()</code>, which takes a positive number
        as an argument and prints the numbers from the specified argument down to zero:
    <pre class="plain"><code>>>> def countdown(n):
...     print(n)
...     if n == 0:
...         return
...     else:
...         countdown(n - 1)
... 
>>> countdown(3)
3
2
1
0</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice how <code>countdown()</code> fits the paradigm for a recursive algorithm described above:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The base case occurs when <code>n</code> is zero, at which point recursion stops.</li>
        <li>In the recursive call, the argument is one less than the current value of <code>n</code>, so each recursion
            moves closer to the base case.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> For simplicity, <code>countdown()</code> doesnâ€™t check its argument for validity.
        If <code>n</code> is either a non-integer or negative, youâ€™ll get a <code>RecursionError</code> exception
        because the base case is never reached.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recursive functions can be quite useful and can also get quite complicated. We might explore more
        examples later.

    <span id="AmazonWebServices"><b>Amazon Web Services</b></span>

    <p>
        To create, configure, and manage AWS services, we will use Boto3,
        the AWS SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python. The SDK
        provides an object-oriented API as well as low-level access
        to AWS services.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's use the Amazon Polly service to turn text into speech. To
        do this, we first need to install <code>boto3</code>:
    <pre class="plain"><code>pip install boto3</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Log in to AWS and go to the IAM Dashboard. With IAM, you can
        specify who can access which services and resources, and under what
        conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Create a user with the username <i>pollytest</i> and attach the policy
        <i>AmazonPollyFullAccess</i> to the <i>pollytest</i> user. Then, create an
        access key for the user to use in their local code.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following code saves an MP3 audio file of the text converted to speech by the
        Amazon Polly service:
    <pre class="plain"><code>
import boto3
import csv

with open('pollytest_accessKeys.csv', mode='r') as file:
    csvFile = csv.reader(file)
    for lines in csvFile:
        access_key_id = lines[0]
        secret_access_key = lines[1]

polly = boto3.client('polly',
                     region_name = 'us-east-1',
                     aws_access_key_id = access_key_id,
                     aws_secret_access_key = secret_access_key)

result = polly.synthesize_speech(Text = 'This is a test!',
                                 OutputFormat = 'mp3',
                                 VoiceId = 'Kendra')

audio = result['AudioStream'].read()

with open('myfile.mp3', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(audio)</code></pre>
    </p>


    <p>
        Let us now use the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). We create a user with the
        username <i>s3test</i> and attach the policy <i>AmazonS3FullAccess</i>.
        Then, create an access key for the user to use in their local code.
    </p>

    <p>
        In S3, all of our data is stored in so-called <i>buckets</i>.
        Bucket names must be unique across the entire AWS platform.
        To create a random name that is likely to be unique, we will use
        the <code>uuid</code> module. This module allows us to generate
        an identification number that will uniquely identify something. The chances
        that two UUIDs are the same are almost zero.
    <pre class="plain"><code></code>import uuid

def create_bucket_name(bucket_prefix):
    # The generated bucket name must be between 3 and 63 chars long
    return ''.join([bucket_prefix, str(uuid.uuid4())])</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like with Amazon Polly, we first need to create an S3 client:
    <pre class="plain"><code>s3_client = boto3.client('s3',
                 region_name='us-east-1',
                 aws_access_key_id=access_key_id,
                 aws_secret_access_key=secret_access_key)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, we create an S3 bucket. If no region is specified, the default is <code>us-east-1</code>:
    <pre class="plain"><code>s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=create_bucket_name('s3test'))</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following code returns a list of existing buckets:
    <pre class="plain"><code>response = s3_client.list_buckets()

for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f'  {bucket["Name"]}', type(response['Buckets']))</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        To upload a file, simply use the following line of code. It uploads the
        file <code>primenumbers.txt</code>, using the same name, to the bucket with the
        randomly generated name
        <code>s3test96b8a029-e9ba-4601-86e5-38f313f5647f</code>:
    <pre
        class="plain"><code>s3_client.upload_file('primenumbers.txt', 's3test96b8a029-e9ba-4601-86e5-38f313f5647f', 'primenumbers.txt')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        When you refresh the web interface, the file will appear in the bucket.
        We might go into all the <code>CRUD</code> operations later.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are now going to use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to deploy a Python app.
        Search for "Elastic Beanstalk" on AWS, then click on <i>Create application</i>.
        Under <i>Configure Environment</i>, select <i>Web server environment</i> and name the
        application <i>beanstalk_test</i>.
        Choose <i>Python</i> as the platform, and under <i>Application code</i>, select
        <i>Sample application</i>.
        Leave the other settings as they are.
    <p>

    <p>
        In step 2, create a service role and then an EC2 instance profile role.
        You will be directed to another page. Just accept the default settings for now.
        After creating the roles, refresh the page; the newly created roles will now appear under <i>Service
            role</i> and <i>EC2 instance profile</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For now, you can accept the defaults in the remaining steps.
        Finally, create the environment. This process may take a couple of minutes.
        Once the environment has been successfully launched, you can click on the domain
        to see the default web application.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can create a simple application using Plotly Dash and then upload
        the main code file along with the <code>requirements.txt</code> file as a single ZIP file.
        Make sure the following two lines of code are included:
    <pre class="plain"><code>application = app.server

if __name__ == '__main__':
    application.run(debug=True, port=5000)
</code></pre>
    </p>
