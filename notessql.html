    <span><b>Notes on SQL</b></span>

    <p>
        These notes provide a rough overview of SQL. I do not claim complete accuracy, but they appear to be correct.
    </p>

    <p>
        Type the following in the terminal and enter the password:
    <pre class="plain"><code>mysql -u root -p</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following query asks the server to return its version number and the current date:
    <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> select version(), current_date;
+-----------+--------------+
| version() | current_date |
+-----------+--------------+
| 9.4.0     | 2025-08-24   |
+-----------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.006 sec)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The above query is simple, but it reveals several things about MySQL:
    <ul>
        <li>A query ends with a semicolon. There are some exceptions.</li>
        <li>When you issue a query, MySQL sends it to the server for execution and displays the results.</li>
        <li>
            MySQL displays the results in tabular form. Normally, column labels are the names of the columns
            you fetch, but if you are retrieving the value of an expression, MySQL labels the column using
            the expression itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            MySQL shows how many rows were returned and how long the query took to execute. Be aware that this only
            gives you a rough idea of performance, as execution time can depend on several other factors.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Keywords may be entered in any letter case. The following query demonstrates that you can use
        MySQL as a simple calculator:
    <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> select sin(pi()/4), (4+1)*5;
+--------------------+---------+
| sin(pi()/4)        | (4+1)*5 |
+--------------------+---------+
| 0.7071067811865475 |      25 |
+--------------------+---------+
1 row in set (0.018 sec)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can enter multiple statements on a single line; they need to be separated by a semicolon.
        A query can also span multiple lines. MySQL determines where your statement ends by looking for the
        terminating semicolon. If you decide you do not want to execute a query while you're in the
        process of entering it, cancel it by typing <code>\c</code>:
    <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> select 
    -> user()
    -> \c
mysql> </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Use the <code>SHOW</code> statement to find out what databases currently exist on the server:
    <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.201 sec)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        If there isn't a database for you to use, you can create it yourself:
    <pre class="plain"><code>create database test;</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Depending on the system, database names (and also table names) are case-sensitive, so it is best to use the
        same lettercase. Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that explicitly:
    <pre class="plain">use test;<code></code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select it for use each time you begin a mysql session.
        The database you just created is empty, as the following query shows:
    <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> show tables;
Empty set (0.002 sec)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        For the moment, we will skip the table creation part and load the <code>test.sql</code> file using
        <code>source test.sql</code>, which creates Northwind sample database used in W3Schools:
        <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> use w3schools; show tables;
Database changed
+---------------------+
| Tables_in_w3schools |
+---------------------+
| Categories          |
| Customers           |
| Employees           |
| OrderDetails        |
| Orders              |
| Products            |
| Shippers            |
| Suppliers           |
+---------------------+
8 rows in set (0.005 sec)</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The simplest way to display columns from a table is to use <code>SELECT * FROM table_name</code>.
        The <code>*</code> specifier is a shortcut that means <i>all columns</i>:
        <pre class="plain"><code>mysql> select * from Orders;
+---------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+
| OrderID | CustomerID | EmployeeID | OrderDate  | ShipperID |
+---------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+
|   10248 |         90 |          5 | 1996-07-04 |         3 |
|   10249 |         81 |          6 | 1996-07-05 |         1 |
|   10250 |         34 |          4 | 1996-07-08 |         2 |
...</code></pre>
